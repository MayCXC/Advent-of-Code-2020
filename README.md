# Advent-of-Code-2020
Just using Scala, avoiding procedural tedium.

I use `repl.sh` to run `Main.scala` with `sbt` to test solutions as they are edited.

So far my best rank was **794** for Day 3 Part 1, but strangely this was also the only day where my Part 2 rank of **1074** was worse than my Part 1 rank...

I am looking for ways to improve the performance of days 7 and 11. For day 7, the given challenge completes quickly, but the community "big boy" input turns my laptop to mush for a few minutes. For day 11, the program seems very straightforward and should have a time complexity in O(n), but the program crawls through each step. If you happen to have an eye for scala bottlenecks, please let me know what you think.
