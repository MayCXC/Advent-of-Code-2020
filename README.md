# Advent-of-Code-2020
Just using Scala, avoiding procedural tedium.

I use `repl.sh` to run `Main.scala` with `sbt` test solutions as they are edited.

So far my best rank was **794** for Day 3 Part 1, but strangely this was also the only day where my Part 2 rank of **1074** was worse than my Part 1 rank...
